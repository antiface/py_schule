teaching python in a simple and inspiring way


####the goal
teaching python in a simple and inspiring way so that kids
- can connect knowledge from maths and physics with programming
- understand the usefulness of numerical computation (more stupid work for the machine, and less headache for me)
- get a feeling of how computers solve problems in our everyday life, e.g. how the physics gets into a computer game, or how a computer manages my library account
Python is a very suitable way here, because it allows so concise, clean, and easily readable code.

####conceptual ideas
Here I start a little collection of introductory python programs suitable for being the starter of programming lessons for kids in high-school age. The highest directive is that the code snippets shall be inspiring, that they shall spark own creative tinkering (instead of blocking it through overwhelming with supposedly best solutions). I hope the first lesson on exponential growth already mirrors this spirit, and that it provokes the own invention of an iterative search algorithm years before such a concept shows up in maths lessons.
