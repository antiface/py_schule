In my opinion this is a good moment for experiencing what a low-pass filter
means for an acoustic signal. One option would be to work with sound
synthesizer software like Reaktor, MAX/MSP, or PureData where noise or a
sawtooth wave can be put through a low-pass filter, the filter's cutoff and Q
can be tweaked, and the signal can be heard and visualised. Or better yet, dig
out an old analogue synthesizer and an oscilloscope.
